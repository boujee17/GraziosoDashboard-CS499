# GraziosoDashboard-CS499

1. Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs
To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I focused on breaking down functionality into small, reusable components. In Project One, I designed the CRUD Python module so that each database operation—Create, Read, Update, and Delete was clearly separated into its own function. This made the code easy to read, debug, and expand later.

Using this module in Project Two to power the dashboard widgets saved time because I didn’t need to rewrite database logic. Instead, I could focus on creating the interface and visualizations while trusting that the database interactions were handled consistently. In the future, I could reuse this same CRUD module for other projects requiring database connections, such as employee management tools, inventory systems, or any data-driven application.

2. Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist
I approached the dashboard and database requirements by first breaking the problem into smaller tasks: building a working CRUD module, connecting it to the database, and then designing interactive dashboard components on top of it. Compared to earlier assignments, this project required more planning because it integrated multiple parts—database, Python backend, and visualization.

In the future, I would use this same modular approach when creating databases for other clients. I would start with a clear understanding of requirements, design reusable components, and test each part before combining them. I would also focus on scalability and security so the system could grow with the client’s needs.

3. What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing systems that handle data efficiently and securely. In this project, my work on the CRUD module and dashboard would help a company like Grazioso Salvare quickly search and filter animal data, improving their ability to match animals with rescue needs.

By automating and organizing data access, companies can make better decisions faster. This not only saves time but also ensures accuracy, helping organizations focus on their mission rather than on manual data processing.
